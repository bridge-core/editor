## Installation & Usage

Our [getting started guide](https://bridge-core.app/guide/) is the perfect way to get familiar with the editor. It will guide you through the installation process and show you how to create your first bridge. project. You can find it [here](https://bridge-core.app/guide/).

Contributing to bridge. can be as "easy" as helping us improve our [documentation](https://github.com/bridge-core/docs/) by editing Markdown files, editing our [editor data](https://github.com/bridge-core/editor-packages/) which mostly consists of JSON or [creating a new extension](/extensions/). You do not need to work on the [core editor](https://github.com/bridge-core/editor/) and its related libraries to make valuable contributions to our projects.
